# MLELMAnalysis_MK6
The sixth version of MLELMAnalysis

This is the sixth version of the hyperspectral localziation software using the X-phase plate and XPSF. It includes a correction to the Gibson-Lani PSF model that allows for the thickness, from the X-phase plate given from the nano-fabrication lab to correctly model the Gibson-Lani PSF. Additionally, this version of the software will eventually include better file management and full commenting.
